h1. semver.lua 

Semantic versioning for Lua.

See http://semver.org/ for details about semantic versioning.

h1. Documentation

    local v = require 'semver'

    -- accepts integers and numbers
    v1 = v(1,0,0)
    v2_5_1 = v('2.5.1')

    -- major, minor and patch attributes
    v2_5_1.major -- 2
    v2_5_1.minor -- 5
    v2_5_1.patch -- 1

    -- 


h1. Installation

Just copy the semver.lua file wherever you want it (for example on a lib/ folder). Then write this in any Lua file where you want to use it. You must assign the require to a global or local variable (I use a local @v@):

<pre>local v = require 'semver'</pre>

Using @v@ allows for the following nice syntax: @v'1.2.3'@.

The @package.path@ variable must be configured so that the folder in which middleclass.lua is copied is available, of course.

Please make sure that you read the license, too (for your convenience it's now included at the beginning of the semver.lua file).

h1. Specs

This project uses "telescope":https://github.com/norman/telescope for its specs. If you want to run the specs, you will have to install telescope first. Then just execute the following from the root inspect folder:

<pre>
tsc -f spec/*
</pre>
